# EMMA – Development of a Basic AI Robot

## Project Overview
EMMA is a basic AI robot developed as an academic project to demonstrate fundamental artificial intelligence concepts. The project focuses on how a robot can receive inputs from sensors, process information, and make simple decisions to perform automated actions.

## Objectives
- To understand basic AI concepts and logic
- To design and develop a simple intelligent robot system
- To integrate hardware and software components
- To demonstrate decision-making based on sensor inputs

## Key Features
- Sensor-based input detection
- Basic decision-making logic
- Automated responses and actions
- Simple and modular system design

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python / Arduino (update if needed)
- Hardware Components: Sensors, Microcontroller, Robot chassis
- Tools: GitHub, GitHub Desktop
- AI Model Runtime: Ollama (local LLM execution, no API key required)

## How the Robot Works
1. Sensors collect data from the environment  
2. The system processes the input data  
3. Decision logic determines the appropriate response  
4. The robot performs actions based on the decision  

## Project Purpose
This project was developed for learning and academic purposes to build a foundation in artificial intelligence and robotics.
